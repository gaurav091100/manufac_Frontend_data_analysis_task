# Frontend Data Analysis Task (Indian Agriculture Dataset)


# Project Overview
This project is designed to analyze agricultural data from India and display it in an interactive, user-friendly format using Mantine v7 and TypeScript. The task is to perform some basic analytics over the dataset, aggregating crop production and average yield and area information over the years (1950-2020).

The project uses a Vite Min Template as the starting point, which is already configured with TypeScript.


# Tech Satck Used
Languages/Libraries/Tools:

TypeScript
Mantine v7 (for table components)
React.js
Vite (for fast development environment)


# Tasks:

Aggregating crop production data to display the crop with maximum and minimum production per year.
Aggregating crop yield and cultivation area to display average values for each crop over the years 1950-2020.
Display the results in two tables:
Crop Production Overview: Maximum and Minimum production per crop for each year.
Average Metrics per Crop: Average yield and average cultivation area per crop.





To get started, clone the repository and install dependencies using Yarn:


git clone https://github.com/gaurav091100/manufac_Frontend_data_analysis_task.git
cd manufac_Frontend_data_analysis_task
yarn install

To run the project locally, execute the following command:

yarn dev
This will start the development server, and your browser will open with the rendered data tables.
